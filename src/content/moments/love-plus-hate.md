My life has been defined by the struggles I have had with expressing myself. For some reason I make
it far enough to do something novel or interesting or funny, but not far enough to make a
sustainable impact on anything. I have an abundance of care within me but lack the criticism to
drive it forward. I have been taught to filter out negative thoughts instead of analyze them fairly,
to give them an equal shot at turning into something constructive. I have made many mistakes with
utilizing negative emotions, and will probably make many more. But it is worth trying to discover
what more I could be, and above all else, not be a boring person.

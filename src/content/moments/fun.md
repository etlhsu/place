Oftentimes I say too little, yet say too much. I simultaneously appear thoughtless and thoughtful. I
have been taught it is focus that demonstrates care. Yet I have learned it is focus that also
demonstrates lack of care. Eventually you spend too much time in the same mental space, which means
you encounter less of what matters. If that mental space shrinks, you get depression. Focus is a
strange entity, being the best and worst of me. Focus can be as much a pursuit of the uncomfortable
as much as it can be a masquerade for the comfortable. It is this part of me that I celebrate the
most, yet it is responsible for every major mistake I have made.

Having [fun](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fun) means exploring the world. There is nothing
amusing, enjoying, or playful about relentlessly focusing on the same stuff. It means rolling the
dice and seeing what you get. It means reconsidering what may have been foolishly considered "not
important". It means being misguided and vulnerable, so that you can reach the places no one else
has been.

I think it is easy to confuse having fun with having success. One is about opportunity discovery,
the other is about opportunity realization. You can have fun without having success, while still
being extremely rational. If you can potentially discover an infinitely large opportunity, than why
is that oftentimes seen as less than realizing an infinitely large opportunity? The two are not
comparable in any sort of way. Successful people have fun not because of the realization, but the
discovery of opportunity. The realization of opportunity tends to lead to the discovery of more
opportunity, which is why such is typically not apparent. And so, to anyone wanting to "copy" a
successful person, they owe it to themselves to make sure they are copying the discovery part of a
successful journey (alongside the realization portion). The good news is that being driven by (happy
from) success instead of fun always self-corrects over time because you cannot realize an
opportunity without discovering it. Hence, the fun is required.

So if fun is required, how can you keep yourself going? Well, here are common ways to come up with
stuff:
1. **Nearby** - Do stuff close in your environment (ex. location) but far away in your situation (ex.
   comfort-level, affiliation)
2. **Playful** - Come up with interesting bits, tell jokes, connect things together, tinker around with
   stuff
3. **Perspective** - Try to learn more about someone else's experiences or something else's value. See
   what others deem as fun as go along for the ride.

To conclude, having fun in interesting ways is the only way to grow as a person. I will do more
things for the fun of them, and hope to encounter more of what matters.

This marks the end of an era where I have been laser focused on a singular goal even beyond its
completion, and the start of an era where I relentlessly ideate and execute for what I care about.

See ya on the other side! \

_Update on April 13, 2024: I need to generate orders of magnitude more of direct and indirect entropy.
The journey will be long, unimpressive, and most definitely boring. But I have learned that it is
an infinitely refined vision of the future combined with an intense hatred of the present that breeds
creativity. To that, I currently have none of those._

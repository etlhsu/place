This landmark has been written and rewritten so many times. There is a social side of me that has
the potential to upgrade every pursuit in my life. I want to learn how to relentlessly ideate and
execute for what I care about and beyond. The journey will be long, unimpressive, and most
definitely boring. For me, it is an infinitely refined vision of the future combined with an intense
hatred of the present that breeds creativity. I want to do awesome things, with awesome people, all
the time.

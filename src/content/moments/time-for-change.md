This personal exposÃ© is an admission of my success and my failure. A success of valuing the ideas of others
but a failure to value my own ideas (and thoughts ðŸ˜¬). As a kid, I spent all of my own time
trying to get into tech. However, the side of the story that I don't tell on [the homepage](/) is 
what it took from me personally. __The only thing I wanted in life was to work
for someone else.__ I wanted to report to somebody so badly that I did everything I could. 

In the pursuit of it, I forgot who I was.

_But why would I aspire to only that?_

The answer: the returns were extremely addicting. It doesn't take much to impress a child who had 
never earned a dollar, never had real responsibility, and truthfully... never had friends. All I 
needed to be happy was a livable income, some work that matters, and friendly coworkers. So when
I was given all of that and more through the work I did, I was high on life. The problem? I wasn't prosperous
all the sudden, instead I was simply given a free trial of prosperity. 

The bad news for me was that the perpetual cost of that prosperity was being entrepreneurial: the
people I collaborated with wanted me to be creative, free-thinking, and curious. By the time I 
realized this, I was the opposite of all three. In fact, I was incredibly creative in how I 
limited my creativity, free-thinking in terms of how much I could restrict myself, and curious what 
it would be like if I wasn't curious at all. I tried to ignore this, but things got much worse. 
Everything disappeared from my bucket list, I became quite toxic, and I wasn't any better at what I 
did. I also depended a lot more on others as I struggled to care about my own thoughts:

> "Why propose your own approach when someone with more experience will have a better approach?"
>
> "Why believe your own opinion when someone with more information will have a better opinion?"

<br>

These logical viruses take advantage of a core principle I hold which is to be anti-competitive. If
someone can do something better or more efficiently than I can, I let them do it. I never think for
myself because I outsource so many of my thoughts to others who I value for their better vision of
how the world should be. Social media is not bad for your health, but you certainly can make it be. All you
have do to is follow expressive people who you care about more than you care about yourself. Eventually
you'll always be sitting on the sidelines, cheering on others but never self-starting, like I am.

...

I'm pretty good at clearing my email, but I'm also pretty good at clearing the thoughts in my head.
Whenever I get a new email, I ask myself what action items the email has, I write down or do such
tasks and then throw away the email. Whenever I get a new idea, I ask myself if it can benefit
the world in any way, and then forget it. As asserted above, I throw most of my ideas away because
I think other people are better positioned to pursue them. My thoughts are as disposable as my email.

I find it funny that meditation classes sell you on "clearing your mind." At least for me, my
baseline of stress (for optimal wellbeing) is extremely high. Clearing my mind also clears my
personality. So constantly convincing myself to sit on the sidelines has nearly erased my soul. I'm
really transparent about it too. I tell people that I do nothing on the weekends and have zero hobbies.
Could you really shove more red flags into a single person?

### How To Think?
Thinking clearly in the 21st century requires much more discipline in order to not be strangled
by hyperaware algorithms, frozen by a lack of confidence, and squeezed by abundant doubt (which all
rightfully exist). 

The trick is to always have some "thing to do". It doesn't matter how much it sucks, or how unjustified
it is, or how impressive it makes you look. All that matters is that the activity exists and you are
doing it. If you think of something better or find anything more exciting to do, then replace the
activity you are doing with it. The important part is to never do more than 1 thing, but never do
less than 1 thing. Always stay at one.

I realized that throughout my journey, I consistently failed to give myself a starting point in life.
I always gave myself a destination like "acquire x to achieve y and influence z". But I never
positioned myself for an adventure that demanded all of me. Refining a single "something" to do
gives an immediate starting point so that I can overcome my skeptical nature, but still gives me
the peace of mind that I care about what I am doing because I can always switch it out with
something else.

_Well of course you can be doing multiple things throughout your days and weeks, but make sure to
really focus on a single, dedicated, special something._

Starting with something you don't like can be tough (and is meant to be), but over time that one
thing you choose to fill all of your random time can evolve and grow into something you are proud
of. It turned out that I used this exact tactic to begin my story of getting a job, it's just that I 
chose to focus on a singular thing that I ended up not being fully proud of (not what I was working
on, but how I worked) and never evolved beyond it. I also was too quick to spread myself thin
spending my time in unfulfilling ways. So when I struggled to value myself, I had nothing to focus
on that could still cultivate my passion. During these times, I keep deferring to people with lots 
to look forward to, but what if I gave myself something to look forward to as well?

...

In retrospect, it seems so obvious to me that my futile goals would seem useless compared to the
incredible advancements pioneered by the world's greatest innovators. But if anything, the largest
trees are the biggest reminders of why we all should be planning the seeds that keep the forest
growing. And if your lucky, those trees might already have a seed for you to start planting ;)

_This is my first moment! I decided to share my story as a case study for why living in the modern
world can be unexpectedly challenging. If my philosophy ends up working, I got whole lotta exciting stuff in the works..._

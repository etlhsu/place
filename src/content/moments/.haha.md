Given the chance, I find it interesting to analyze the delta between the average Joe (like me) and 
the world's greatest people. Well... greatest is quite an objective word. How about richest,
most resourceful, or happiest? These days I see many signals that all three of those
qualities are found together. In other words, it's quite difficult to only be useful to the
economy, or just useful to others, or just useful to yourself. Instead, it is only worthwhile to
go after all three at the same time. But how is going after multiple things better than one if going
after one thing is impossible?

<p>. . .</p>

I've spent a lot of my time chasing things that other people wanted from me. In fact, I've pursued 
values that I had which solely existed to give other people more things. In my futile defense, it's
really hard not to. The world basically exists so that we can do things for other people. I don't
care how ruthless or isolated an entity (like a company) is, the only reason why that thing even
exists in the first place is to do something for someone. Upon first glance, it seems totally fine
to live in the zeitgeist of society. However, there are some limits to this way of life that should
scare even the most tolerant of people.

The main disadvantage (by far) is that you will mostly be doing things that go from 1 -> 1, or 1
-> 0. This means that by being the societal equivalent of a sitting duck, you will only ever do
things that create a similar amount of work for yourself in the future, or end up creating nothing
for you to do at all. Most things that are 1 -> 1 eventually go to 1 -> 0.5 -> 0.2 -> 0.1 -> 0. It seems
a bit weird how society grows if most people end up doing 1 -> 1 things. But if you trace things
back a bit, things start to make sense. Likely the person you're employed by, assisting, or 
reporting to has been given an opportunity that is 1 -> 5 or even 1 -> 100. These kinds of
opportunities are imagination and ideation, where the "1" is either a problem/thing to do that you
find, or a problem/thing to do that reaches you somehow else. Eventually, the "5" or "100" is split
up into many 1 -> 1 opportunities that are delegated to you.

In recent times, I've personally felt terrible only pursuing 1 -> 1 and 1 -> 0 things. By doing such
it means that I am betting against my own abilities grow the world by doing 1 -> 2 things. It means
that for as hard as I try, I'm always depending on someone/something else to water the plants in
the magical garden of society and harvest the seeds of opportunity.. Of course, that idea itself
is not concrete, just a realization that my significance has vanished. In high-growth areas like
tech, we're told that the majority of people are creating value for the world. I'd like to clarify
that most people are simply implementing value, they are doing the 1 -> 1 things, not the 1 -> 100
stuff.

So how do you escape the 1 -> 1, 1 -> 0 lifestyle? Well that's where silliness comes into the mix.
Undeniably, silliness is a way of flailing, of seeing what might be out there. You don't really
know something is funny until it is shared, just like you don't know if an idea is good until it
is tried. As simple of a feeling as it is, I see laughing is a way of cultivating opportunities. It
can show you what matters to people, or what doesn't. It can reveal things that are laughably bad,
or things that laughably amazing. It fascinates me as a 1 than never turns into a 0. No matter how
silly something is, it always can be sillier, much sillier. Feelings don't have an expiration date
or a set limit.

I see most acts of silliest as a way of lighting the dark unknown places. They shine enough light
for you to see the paths ahead, but not enough light for you to see everything. I'll end off with
a question:

Would you rather be traveler who walks the path of life finding new places or just someone who
lives at a stop along the way?

_Indeed a tangent_

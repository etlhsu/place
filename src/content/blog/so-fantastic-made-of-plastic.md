When you think about futuristic technology, you typically think about complex digital matrices
plastered on equally complex control panels and command centers. But no one would have guessed that
the direction of interaction would have steered more towards toys that simplify the world down to
a few button presses, exciting buzzes, and occasional dings. So what is really happening to the 
things people enjoy?

The idea for this piece came about when I took a closer look at the way buttons, switches and other
building blocks of visual software have morphed over time. Take Google's 
[Material Design](https://material.io), which was one of the first comprehensive design systems 
to take a shot at answering the question of how to make things visually consistent across the 
everyday digital stuff that people use. Their design team has recently revised the system's set of 
UI components (the visual things that users interact with) and released Material Design 3. 
When you take a look at how such components appear in an email app (from an official 
[depiction](https://m3.material.io/components/floating-action-button/overview)) there seems to be 
one big difference (literally):

In case you haven't noticed, the main button for creating an email is just... huge. This kind of
design philosophy was previously deemed a bit strange since it creates an imbalance between certain
parts of the screen. However such changes force us to rethink the purpose of software. Is it really
intended to be as functional as possible? If functionality is having a Swiss Army Knife that performs as
many functions as possible, then usability is having a knife that does a few refined things well.

In the past, the journey of software was all about providing as much value as possible in a single
package. But that was back in an age where software was much more difficult to ship, and people
using tools generally were much more opinionated about how they wanted to use them. These days,
people seem to be hoping for software that creates the best experiences possible. That could be
emphasizing (pointing out to users) the most common ways people use certain tools the most, creating
features that drive self-perpetuating interaction, or by evolving over time. 

The toy-ification of software is an inherent shift in trust, a careful balance of making people do
things a certain way to prove it is worth their time, but then allowing users to discover the best
ways to address their own needs. It plays on our instincts to be told what to do, but also to have
control over how we do it (though I suppose having the most functionality doesn't create such a
feeling). Toys treat the onboarding/learning journey as a constant instead of just a step in the
process. In a way, such a design paradigm is empathetic to users who might not be able to remember
how to do everything perfectly the first time (a.k.a. everyone).

When you apply these principles to the way the current world of digital stuff behaves, some tools 
are subject to the Fisher Price Effect a lot more than others. Given these core ideas are the norm,
it seems odd that Microsoft Word doesn't ask you to write the next document as soon as you finish 
the current one or that Google Calendar isn't good for throwing parties. However, social networks
are a much different story as they employ infinitely scrolling feeds to create an everlasting,
adaptable digital experience. In my opinion, what makes the scrolling feeds of social media so
compelling that [even a Monkey likes it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTiZqCQsfa8) versus
other kinds of limitless content rivers is that at their best, social media has no UI. When using
social networks, they fully immerse you in what you are looking at. TikTok's iconic full-screen
scrolling video UI is the perfect example.

So why invest lots of time designing a UI that encourages people to do things if you 
don't need one in the first place? Software that is used to create experiences will always play 
second fiddle to software that **is** the experience. It may sound simple, but can the world fully
depend on toys that amplify who we are instead of encouraging who we want to be?

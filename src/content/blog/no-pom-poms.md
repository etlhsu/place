From a philosophical standpoint (oh great, here we go again), I want to discover a part of the 
world that otherwise would not be found. What fun is there in finding/doing/being something that
would have been done anyways? If you know anything about me, I've lived a life of surprise. I think
the benefits of surprise are so amazing that I want to pay it forward to others. The feeling, the
opportunity, the belonging, the hope, all of it.

I want to build things that create surprise in people's lives. But what do I
build? Well, an important principle in my life is that I'm extremely anti-competitive.
So I want to let the crypto techies and AI guys do their thing. But what if I could make
the environment they operate in 10% better? Well that's the mantra of every B2B SaaS company
on the planet. But I don't even want to compete with them. What if I could make the operating
environment of the world 10% better in such a way that no one even wants to compete with me?

If history has taught me anything, it is that creating things that attempt to control happiness and
the magic in people's lives usually leads to terrible outcomes (ironically, outcomes so bad that they
otherwise would not have been found). Good or bad, messing around with the sudoscience of what
makes people who they are is a hobby for the insane (of all kinds). All happiness 
things/efforts/forces fall apart in one of two ways:

  1. When a force for happiness becomes too tangible, people develop resistances for it and there 
  emerge opposing forces to take it down.
  2. When a force for happiness becomes too spread out, momentum for it becomes lost and the 
  original spirit behind it becomes lost.

Of course, if something has a way in, it will always have a way out. However, I think happiness
could be better pegged to things in our lives that are a lot more durable. My general observation
with the increasing popularity in social media and gaming is that we are trying to build a separate
world for happiness, one that is distinct from the things we do which move the world forward. I 
think Mark Zuckerberg failed to realize the metaverse not because he was blasted away by difficult
engineering challenges but instead because he slipped on a banana peel. Simply put, no one wants
to live in two realities, because one of them will always be better. He should've built upon
today's interactions, not invent tomorrow's. The cost of not doing that? A billion-dollar *gulp*.

A key part of a successful surprise is creating unexpected reactions. "I love this" and "I hate this"
are novel emotions, but people can always find a better "hit" of those emotions somewhere else. On the 
other hand, where the heck is someone supposed to find a "better surprise?" I bet the title of this 
article gave you a reaction of surprise. You didn't know whether you liked me or hated me from, but
instead chose to read because you saw a couple words that you've never seen put together on a blog.

Going forward, I want to unlock a part of the world that nobody even knows exists (even me). I want
to be a counterweight against all of the people that profiteer from build experiences that 
depend on people staying the same. 

If that's you, I'm sorry :( But so much is yet to be experienced if the value proposition of 
encouragement is realized and celebrated.

Part of what makes my mission a bit strange is that you can't quite grasp all of what I am saying. After
all, I did admit if I fully knew what I was doing, I would certainly be opposed by something and 
taken down (likely indirectly). I will never have a startup pitch deck that
is fully complete or an investment thesis that soothes Wall Street. I have no critical user to 
idealize or elevator pitch to glamorize, just the interactions I build and that's it.

We'll see how things go, hopefully I can turn the world people work and live in into the world 
people play in as well.

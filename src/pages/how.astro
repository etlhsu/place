<Layout	title="How?">
	<p>How is the question I always ask myself. How does the world work? How I can be a part of it?
     How can I change the way the world works? How do I matter? How can I come up with more of 
     these questions?
    <br><br>

     .how domains are meant to tell you "how" something works. Hopefully by exploring this place,
     you can learn how I work :) But also, the "how" is meant to create a sense of wonder. For as 
     many answers as I give, I want to ask just as many questions. I define myself as much by the
     answers that define my previous journeys, as I do the questions that define my next journeys.
     <br><br>

     And for the simple question of "how am I doing?" you might ask, I answer: "I'm doing wonderful" ðŸ˜‡
